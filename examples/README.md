Almost all the examples under this directory have 4 files :

- **sample.pdf** : A sample pdf file whose text contents are to be extracted
- **sample.txt** : The original text contents for *sample.pdf*. All the *sample.txt* files have been generated using the following process :
	- Open *sample.pdf* using Adobe Acrobat Reader
	- Save the file as a text file
- **example.php** : A script that shows the contents of *sample.txt* and the text contents extracted from *sample.pdf*
- **README.md** : A text file that explains how the contents of *sample.pdf* were generated.
